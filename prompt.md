I would like you to define my case study using the description below as Microservice Architecture.

I want to create a website for my massage business, Kenko Massage, so that customers can book appointments by purchasing a coupon that will expire in a month. I want the website to be simple to use, with users only needing to choose the type of massage and the duration of the massage before making payment. After purchasing the coupon, customers can keep it on the website and send it to their email, login to view the recipe with a QR code, and use their coupon ID to use the massage service.

The admin website can manage the menu that appears on the user website; it can be added, removed, changed in price, duration, and discount promotion, but not instantly. I want to create a dashboard that allows me to see when a coupon is bought, used, expires, and can be redeemed by users when they show up by scanning a QR code or entering the coupon ID.
